yippee noodles:

the current marketting strategy is showing that the yippee is non sticky noodles and taste is shown that it is good.
nutrients in ordinary noodles like fat, potassium soduim is higher than yippee so it can be displayed in the add and the idea of trekking can be used to show the health concern.
and instant noodles are not in yippee that can be taken on the trekk.


As a new strategy yippee being non sticky can be used while trekking as hot instant noodles.
A different flavours are there but chat is something that is loved by everyone and it not there so this new flavour is cherry on the cake.

so there is a group of friends on trekk and all are hungry, one of them is having that instant hot noodles with chat chatapat. He shows them the yippee noodles non sticky with a great flavour.
they eat and enjoy
